The "clusterman" Service
=======================

This repository contains a trivial service called `clusterman`.
You can run it by doing something like

    # Using paasta local-run
    $ paasta local-run --cluster norcal-devc --instance main

    # Or running natively to the host
    $ PORT=<port> STATS_PORT=<stats_port> serviceinit.d/clusterman start-dev

    # Note that you must ensure using the virtualenv from your service
    $ make virtualenv_run && source virtualenv_run/bin/activate

The documentation for this service should be available at:
