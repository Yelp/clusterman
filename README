The "clusterman" Service
=======================

Clusterman is an autoscaler for Mesos clusters that will also provide
capabilities to simulate and predict how changes to autoscaling logic will
impact the cost, performance, and resource utilization of the applications,
allowing us to effectively optimize those metrics. This service will run the
batches and tasks for metrics collection, autoscaling, and analysis.

This is a batch/daemon only service. You can run batches by doing something like

    # Using paasta local-run
    $ paasta local-run --cluster norcal-devc --instance main --cmd 'exec dumb-init python {cmd}'

    # Note that you must ensure using the virtualenv from your service
    $ make virtualenv_run && source virtualenv_run/bin/activate
