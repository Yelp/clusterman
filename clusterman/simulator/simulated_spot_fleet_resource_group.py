class SimulatedSpotFleetResourceGroup(SimulatedAWSCluster, AWSResourceGroup):
    """ An implementation of a SimulatedAWSCluster designed to model the AWS EC2 Spot Fleet object, which is also a
    AWSResourceGroup in a simulated Mesos cluster.

    The simulated spot fleet resource group object encapsulates a group of spot instances and attempts to maintain a
    specified capacity of those instances, as long as the bid price for the instances does not exceed a user-specified
    threshold.  If a fleet gets outbid in a particular market, the spot fleet will try to replenish the needed capacity
    in one or more different markets.  Users may specify an instance weight for each requested market, which will be
    used in capacity calculations.

    AWS provides two modes for allocating new instances, called the "allocation strategy": lowestPrice, and diversified.
    This model implementation only supports the diversified strategy; moreover, the details on how spot fleets maintain
    capacity with the diversified strategy are sparse, so this implementation provides a naive diversification strategy
    based on the limited documentation provided by AWS.

    Specifically, the diversification strategy implemented here does the following:
    1. Find all available markets (where an available market is defined as one in which the current price is no greater
       than the bid price in that market)
    2. Compute the residual capacity needed to bring each available market up to the same capacity
    3. Starting with the market having the smallest residual capacity, assign enough instances to the available markets
       to "cover" their residual capacity.
       a. Since instance weights may not evenly divide the residual capacity, there may be some overflow in a market.
          Any overflow is subtracted evenly from each of the remaining markets to ensure that we don't allocate too many
          new instances in other markets.
       b. If two markets have the same residual capacity, we fill the market with the cheaper spot price first.
