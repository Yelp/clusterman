import mock

# This is a ridiculous hack; we need this patch to be applied before pytest imports any other conftest
# files, because if any other conftest file imports anything that imports anything that imports CACHE_TTL_SECONDS
# that value won't get overridden correctly.  Initially I used pytest_configure/pytest_unconfigure to patch
# the value, but even that didn't work because pytest imports all conftests before executing pytest_configure.
# So instead, we just ensure that CACHE_TTL_SECONDS gets patched as soon as pytest imports the first conftest.py
# (this one), and since we want it patched for the entirety of the test run, we don't need to call _ttl_patch.__exit__()

# suffice it to say, you shouldn't put anything else in this file

_ttl_patch = mock.patch("clusterman.aws.CACHE_TTL_SECONDS", -1)
_ttl_patch.__enter__()
