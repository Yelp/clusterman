Configuration
=============

There are two levels of configuration for Clusterman.  The first configures the Clusterman application or service
itself, for operators of the service.  The second provides per-pool configuration, for client applications to customize
scaling behavior.

.. _service_configuration:

Service Configuration
----------------------

The following is an example configuration file for the core Clusterman service and application:

.. code-block:: yaml

    aws:
        access_key_file: /etc/boto_cfg/clusterman.json
        region: us-west-1

    autoscale_signal:  # configures the default signal for Clusterman
        name: MostRecentCPU

        # What version of the signal to use (a branch or tag in the clusterman_signals Git repo)
        branch_or_tag: v1.0.2

        # How frequently the signal will be evaluated.
        period_minutes: 10

        required_metrics:
            - name: cpus_allocated
              type: system_metrics

              # The metric will be queried for the most recent data in this range.
              minute_range: 10

    autoscaling:
        # signal namespace for the default signal
        default_signal_pool: clusterman

        # Percentage utilization that Clusterman will try to maintain.
        setpoint: 0.7

        # Clusterman will only scale if percentage change of current and new target capacities  is
        # beyond this margin.
        target_capacity_margin: 0.1

        # Clusterman will not scale down if, since the last run, the capacity has decreased by more than
        # this threshold. Note that this includes capacity removed by Clusterman in the last run and
        # capacity lost for any other region (e.g. instance failures).
        prevent_scale_down_after_capacity_loss: true
        instance_loss_threshold: 2

    # How long to wait for an agent to "drain" before terminating it
    drain_termination_timeout_seconds:
      sfr: 100

    batches:
        cluster_metrics:
            # How frequently the batch should run to collect metrics.
            run_interval_seconds: 60

        spot_prices:
            # Max one price change for each (instance type, AZ) in this interval.
            dedupe_interval_seconds: 60

            # How frequently the batch should run to collect metrics.
            run_interval_seconds: 60

        node_migration:
            # Maximum number of worker prcesses the batch can spawn
            # (every worker can handle a single migration for a pool)
            max_worker_processes: 6

            # How frequently the batch should check for migration triggers.
            run_interval_seconds: 60

            # Maximum number of restarts for an event worker
            max_failed_attemps: 5

    clusters:
        cluster-name:
            aws_region: us-west-2
            mesos_api_url: <Mesos cluster FQDN>
            kubeconfig_path: /path/to/kubeconfig.conf

    cluster_config_directory: /nail/srv/configs/clusterman-pools/

    module_config:
      - namespace: clog
        config:
            log_stream_name: clusterman
        file: /nail/srv/configs/clog.yaml
        initialize: yelp_servlib.clog_util.initialize

      - namespace: clusterman_metrics
        file: /nail/srv/configs/clusterman_metrics.yaml

      - namespace: yelp_batch
        config:
            watchers:
              - aws_key_rotation: /etc/boto_cfg/clusterman.json
              - clusterman_yaml: /nail/srv/configs/clusterman.yaml


The ``aws`` section provides the location of access credentials for the AWS API, as well as the region in which
Clusterman should operate.

The ``autoscale_signal`` section defines the default signal for autoscaling. This signal will be used for a pool, if
that pool does not define its own ``autoscale_signal`` section in its pool configuration.

The ``autoscaling`` section defines settings for the autoscaling behavior of Clusterman.

The ``batches`` section configures specific Clusterman batches, such as the autoscaler and metrics collection batches.

The ``clusters`` section provides the location of the clusters which Clusterman knows about.

The ``module_config`` section loads additional configuration values for Clusterman modules, such as
``clusterman_metrics``.

.. _pool_configuration:

Pool Configuration
------------------

To configure a pool, a directory with the cluster's name should be created in the ``cluster_config_directory``
defined in the service configuration. Within that directory, there should be a file named ``<pool>.yaml``.
The following is an example configuration file for a particular Clusterman pool:

.. code-block:: yaml

    draining:
      draining_time_threshold_seconds: 1200
      force_terminate: true
      redraining_delay_seconds: 60

    resource_groups:
      - sfr:
          tag: 'my-custom-resource-group-tag'

    scaling_limits:
        min_capacity: 1
        max_capacity: 800
        max_weight_to_add: 100
        max_weight_to_remove: 100
        max_tasks_to_kill: 100
        min_node_scalein_uptime_seconds: 300


    autoscale_signal:
        name: CustomSignal
        namespace: my_application_signal

        # What version of the signal to use (a tag in the clusterman_signals Git repo)
        branch_or_tag: v3.7

        # How frequently the signal will be evaluated.
        period_minutes: 10

        required_metrics:
            - name: cpus_allocated
              type: system_metrics

              # The metric will be queried for the most recent data in this range.
              minute_range: 10

        # custom parameters to be passed into the signal (optional)
        parameters:
            - paramA: 'typeA'
            - paramB: 10

    node_migration:
        trigger:
            max_uptime: 90d
            event: true
        strategy:
            rate: 5
            prescaling: '2%'
            precedence: highest_uptime
            bootstrap_wait: 5m
            bootstrap_timeout: 15m
        disable_autoscaling: false
        expected_duration: 2h

The ``resource-groups`` section provides information for loading resource groups in the pool manager.

The ``scaling_limits`` section provides global pool-level limits on scaling that the autoscaler and
other Clusterman commands should respect. The field ``min_node_scalein_uptime_seconds`` is an optional
setting allowing to indicate a timespan in which freshly bootstrapped nodes are deprioritized in the
selection for termination.

The ``autoscale_signal`` section defines the autoscaling signal used by this pool.  This section is optional. If it is
not present, then the ``autoscale_signal`` from the service configuration will be used.

For required metrics, there can be any number of sections, each defining one desired metric.  The metric type must be
one of :ref:`metric_types`.

The ``node_migration`` section contains settings controlling how Clusterman should be recycling nodes
inside the pool. Enabling this configuration is useful for keeping the average uptime of your pool low and/or
be able to perform adhoc migrations of the nodes according to some conditional parameter.
See :ref:`node_migration_configuration` for all details.

Reloading
---------
The Clusterman batches will automatically reload on changes to the clusterman service config file and the AWS
credentials file.  This is specified in the ``namespace: yelp_batch`` section of the main configuration file.  The
autoscaler batch and the metrics collector batch also will automatically reload for changes to any pools that are
configured to run on the specified cluster.

.. warning:: Any changes to these configuration files will cause the signal to be reloaded by the autoscaling batch.
   Test your config values before pushing.  If the config values break the custom signal, then the pool will start using
   the default signal.
