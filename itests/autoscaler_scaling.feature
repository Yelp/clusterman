Feature: make sure the autoscaler scales to the proper amount

    # The setpoint here is 0.7 with a margin of +/- 0.1 (see environment.py), and we're assuming that
    # we were exactly at the setpoint of 0.7 * 80 = 56.
    # Thus the window of CPU resource requests for which the autoscaler won't make changes is
    # [51, 61] CPUs (inclusive)  (51 / 56 = 0.91, 50 / 56 = 0.90, 61 / 56 = 1.089 62 / 56 = 1.107)
    #
    # We have min_capacity = 3, max_capacity = 100, max_weight_to_add = 200, max_weight_to_remove = 10
    Scenario Outline: make sure the autoscaler requests the right number of resources
       Given a cluster with 2 resource groups
         And 20 target capacity
         And 80 CPUs, 1000 MB mem, 1000 MB disk, and 0 GPUs
         And a mesos autoscaler object
        When the signal resource request is <value>
         And the autoscaler runs
        Then no exception is raised
         And the autoscaler should scale rg1 to <rg1_target> capacity
         And the autoscaler should scale rg2 to <rg2_target> capacity

      Examples:
        | value     | rg1_target | rg2_target |
        | empty     | 10         | 10         |
        | 51 cpus   | 10         | 10         |
        | 56 cpus   | 10         | 10         |
        | 61 cpus   | 10         | 10         |
        | 70 cpus   | 13         | 12         |
        | 1000 cpus | 50         | 50         |
        | 42 cpus   | 8          | 8          |
        | 2 cpus    | 5          | 5          |
        | 0 gpus    | 5          | 5          |

    Scenario Outline: make sure the autoscaler works on empty pools
       Given a cluster with 2 resource groups
         And 20 target capacity
         And 80 CPUs, 1000 MB mem, 1000 MB disk, and 0 GPUs
         And a mesos autoscaler object
        When the pool is empty
         And metrics history <exists>
         And the signal resource request is <value>
         And the autoscaler runs
        Then no exception is raised
         And the autoscaler should scale rg1 to <rg1_target> capacity
         And the autoscaler should scale rg2 to <rg2_target> capacity

      Examples:
        | value     | rg1_target | rg2_target | exists |
        | 0 cpus    | 0          | 0          |     no |
        | 20 cpus   | 1          | 0          |     no |
        | 20 cpus   | 21         | 20         |    yes |

    Scenario: requesting GPUs on a pool without GPU instances is an error
       Given a cluster with 2 resource groups
         And 20 target capacity
         And 80 CPUs, 1000 MB mem, 1000 MB disk, and 0 GPUs
         And a mesos autoscaler object
        When the signal resource request is 1 gpus
         And the autoscaler runs
        Then a ResourceRequestError is raised

    Scenario: the autoscaler does nothing when it is paused
       Given a cluster with 2 resource groups
         And 20 target capacity
         And 80 CPUs, 1000 MB mem, 1000 MB disk, and 0 GPUs
         And a mesos autoscaler object
        When the autoscaler is paused
         And the signal resource request is 1000 cpus
        Then no exception is raised
         And the autoscaler should do nothing

    Scenario Outline: the default PendingPodsSignal works correctly
       Given a cluster with 2 resource groups
         And 20 target capacity
         And 80 CPUs, 1000 MB mem, 1000 MB disk, and 0 GPUs
         And 56 CPUs allocated, <pending> CPUs pending, and <boost> boost factor
         And a kubernetes autoscaler object
        When the autoscaler runs
        Then no exception is raised
         And the autoscaler should scale rg1 to <rg1_target> capacity
         And the autoscaler should scale rg2 to <rg2_target> capacity

      Examples:
        | pending   | boost | rg1_target | rg2_target |
        | 0         |       | 10         | 10         |
        | 14        |       | 16         | 15         |
        | 1000      |       | 50         | 50         |
        | 0         | 2     | 20         | 20         |
        | 50        | 2     | 28         | 28         |
